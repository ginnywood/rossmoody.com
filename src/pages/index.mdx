Product designer by trade, front-end engineer at heart. Currently working on the ðŸŒ± [Garden Design System](https://garden.zendesk.com/) at Zendesk out in sunny San Francisco.

## About

I'm a web, mobile and product designer that can't stop trying to be an engineer. I've created companies, led teams and helped launch products. I'm a problem solver with an endless curiosity for figuring out how things work and I enjoy making products feel polished.

I started my career in advertising, worked for a bit in publishing, started my own screenprinting stationery business, taught myself Javascript and lately I spend my free time being a pretty shitty woodworker.

A browser extension that finds SVGs on the internet to download or copy to clipboard. My first side project while learning [how to write Javascript](https://github.com/rossmoody/svg-gobbler).

### [55 Hi's](https://www.55his.com)

55 Hi's was an online stationery brand I owned and operated for several years. We made all kinds of fun things like [cards that turn into a shot glass](https://www.55his.com/collections/best-seller/products/shot-glass-card) and [cards for narcissists.](https://www.55his.com/collections/best-seller/products/narcissist-b-day)

### [Brave Browser](https://www.brave.com)

Though I was just a small part of a much larger movement, I did help the [Brave Browser](https://www.brave.com) launch its flagship offering when it migrated to Chromium.
