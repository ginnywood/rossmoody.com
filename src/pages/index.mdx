Product designer by trade, front-end engineer at heart. Currently working on the ðŸŒ± [Garden Design System](https://garden.zendesk.com/) at Zendesk out in sunny San Francisco.

## About

I'm a graphic designer that evolved into a product designer that can't stop trying to be an engineer.

I have a tendency to get fanatical about difficult hobbies so I can figure out the most effective way to do them. Once I start to get good at it I become bored and move on to something new. This is probably why I'm so drawn to systems design.

## Recent writing

### [6 Tips for writing effective design documentation](https://link.medium.com/UFRImr6Oo4)

I wrote this article to document what Iâ€™m learning professionally while leading the new Garden Design System site in 2020. This is both so that I can be intentional about my efforts to improve and so that others may find something useful from my lessons.

A browser extension that finds SVGs on the internet to download or copy to clipboard. My first side project while learning [how to write Javascript](https://github.com/rossmoody/svg-gobbler).

### [55 Hi's](https://www.55his.com)

55 Hi's was an online stationery brand I owned and operated for several years. We made all kinds of fun things like [cards that turn into a shot glass](https://www.55his.com/collections/best-seller/products/shot-glass-card) and [cards for narcissists.](https://www.55his.com/collections/best-seller/products/narcissist-b-day)

### [Brave Browser](https://www.brave.com)

Though I was just a small part of a much larger movement, I did help the [Brave Browser](https://www.brave.com) launch its flagship offering when it migrated to Chromium.
